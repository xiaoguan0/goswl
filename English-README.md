# goswl

# Cause

I am a too idle person. I downloaded several wsl systems from the `microsoft store`

<br>

There are too many downloads, the operation is very troublesome, and I'm used to using `linux`

<br>

What should I do? Never use a mouse when I can `knock on the keyboard!!!`

<br>

So The spark of collision between `python` and `wsl`

#Usage

Just type the `system name` directly. The system name that is easy to be `confused` has been `automatically processed`, and will also give a warm `prompt`

<br>

If the name is too long, it will also be processed automatically. When it is opened, it will be prompted with `info`

#About Open Source

It is forbidden to `sell` (no one `sell` hey)
